##first code:

##should include bringing in csv files from database
##this is what I used to load and view the header for the WPBR query on my computer. Do I need to upload the .csv files to GitHub?
##what I'm calling WPBR has fields mostly from the tree details table and a few from the tree location table.
##I included all the fields relevant to WPBR analysis (original and present day methods). We will probably need to add the comments too.
> setwd("~/Documents/WPBR")
> wpbr=read.csv("tbl_Tree_Detail_WPBRQuery.csv")
> head(wpbr)

##Beetles Data only
> beetles <- read.csv("Beetles_test.csv")
> head (beetles)

##once I determine this is working, I can made another .csv like wpbr, but with comments, beetles, and fire
